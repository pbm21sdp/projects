The project consists of a MATLAB script which is able to decode Morse audio to text, using the CODEX standard. 
It was developed during the 'Data Acquisition and Processing' course, taught by Dr. Habil. Eng. Mihai V. Micea, under the supervision of Dr. Eng. Eugenia-Ana Capota.
It is not the result of individual work, but of team effort, by my colleague, Pap Sara-Kristin and I. 
Dr. Habil. Eng. Mihai V. Micea and Dr. Eng. Eugenia-Ana Capota provided tools to aid in the development process, including documentation, the MATLAB environment and support. The code relied on two files included in the documentation: newFile.m. and morse_decode.m.
Thank you, Sara, I couldn't have done any of this without you.
